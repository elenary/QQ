We cannot calculate it directly, so we have to resort to sample estimates , which are often denoted by the same letter as the parameter of the general population, only “with a cap” or “with a line” X̅ is the sample mean, the average height of people in a specific sample.\nSo, when we want to make a conclusion about all people from the general population, we conduct a study on a small sample (depending on the research method, the required sample size can be from 10 to 1000 people) and estimate the studied parameter of the general population based on sample estimates.\nTo avoid confusion about what we are talking about, key population and sample estimates are referred to differently:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGeneral population\nSample\n\n\n\n\nMean (mathematical expectation)\n\\(\\mu\\)\nM, \\(\\overline X\\)\n\n\nStandard deviation\n\\(\\sigma\\)\ns, sd",

Then, from these income strata, subjects are selected randomly.\nCluster sampling includes entire individual clusters, without random selection within them: for example, we are studying schoolchildren, and instead of selecting them randomly, we include several specific schools (clusters) in the sample.",

For example, in our example of the effect of caffeine on attention, we can recruit a group of people who will drink 3 cups of coffee a day, and another group who will drink decaffeinated coffee. These are different people, not related to each other in any way.\nBut if we took the same group of people and measured their attention after 3 cups of coffee in one week, and then tested the effects of a decaffeinated drink on these same people , these would be dependent samples , since these are still the same people.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCase\n\n\nResearcher Nikita studied the relationship between age, teaching experience and professional burnout of university teachers. For this, he selected several universities: Moscow State University, the Higher School of Economics and RANEPA. Nikita found 10 teachers from the psychology departments of each university on the VKontakte social network and asked them to fill out the Maslach Burnout Inventory (MBI). Based on the processed data, Nikita made the following conclusions: 1) in Russia, younger teachers burn out more often; 2) teachers with less teaching experience burn out more often; 3) MSU teachers generally burn out less than HSE teachers.

But if we consider the number of people infected with coronavirus, there is no way it can be 27.5 or 31,666.. - the number of people infected is not expressed as fractional shares of one person.\nAn important concept here is the range of admissible values .

    "text": "2.5 3.5 How can I determine what scale the data is on?\nThis is quite a difficult question, and at first it is very difficult to answer it ( and this is normal ). The most difficult thing is to distinguish an ordinal scale from an interval scale, and from the point of view of measurement theory this establishment is not an easy task at all. We rarely encounter a classical interval scale like temperature in degrees Celsius or a scale of chronology in our studies, but the data of the sum scores of questionnaires, most often, also belong to the interval scale, although they have more ordinal properties (it is difficult to say that between 20 and 30 points on the Beck anxiety scale there is exactly the same anxiety interval as between 60 and 70 points). We would rather classify it as an ordinal scale due to the fact that there are a lot of divisions on this scale (more than when we evaluate something on a scale from 1 to 5), and we do not want to limit ourselves to statistical methods suitable for working only with an ordinal scale and not higher. In other cases, defining the scale is a little easier. I suggest using the following simplified algorithm for determining the scale for the first time:\n\nAre there any letters in the variable values? If so, it is either a nominative scale or an ordinal scale.\nCan we arrange these letter values ​​in a certain order on the x-scale? Will anything change if we swap adjacent values? If yes, it is an ordinal scale, if no, it is a nominative scale (for example, I can arrange the names of universities in any order, but the places taken in competitions, only in the order 1-2-3, the change 1-3-2 ruins the meaning)\nIf the answer to (1) is no, and there are no letter values, can the numbers be replaced with letters without changing anything? If yes, then this is also a nominative scale (e.g., subject ID)\nIf there are no letters and the numbers in the data cannot be replaced by letters, it can be either an ordinal scale, an interval scale, or a ratio scale.\nAre the intervals on the scale equal at different places? Will the interval, for example, 20 to 30 include exactly the same number of values ​​as the interval from 50 to 60? If not, it is an ordinal scale; if yes, it is either an interval or a ratio scale.\nIs there an absolute zero on the scale? Doesn’t it sound absurd to say that “value 1” is so many times greater or less than “value 2”? If so, it’s a ratio scale; if not, it’s an interval scale. Done!",
